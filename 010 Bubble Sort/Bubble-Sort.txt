Write a function that takes an array of interger and returns a sorted version of the array. Use Bubble Sort because screw you we need to make this hard to justify you getting the job at the company you're applying for. 


What is bubble sort? where you're incrementally swapping the numbers next to one another 

example: [8,5,2] -> [5,8,2] -> [5,2,8] -> [2,5,8]
