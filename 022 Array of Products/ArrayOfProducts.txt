Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of intergers and returns an array of the same length, where each element in the output array is equal to the product of every other number in the input array.

sample input:
array = [5, 1, 4, 2]

sample output:
[8, 40, 10, 20]

// 8 is equal to 1 x 4 x 2
// 40 is equal to 5 x 4 x 2 
// 10 is equal to 5 x 1 X 2
// 20 is equal to 5 x 1 x 4
