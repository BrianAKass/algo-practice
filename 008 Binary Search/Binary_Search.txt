Write a function that takes a sorted array as well as a target interger. The function will use Binary search algorithm to determine if the target is in the array and return its index. If it doesn't the function will return -1.

Example:

INPUT:
Array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
Target = 33

OUTPUT: 3
