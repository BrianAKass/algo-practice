Find the closest value to a given target in a binary search tree. 


Example what is the closest value to 12 in the bst bellow? answer 13.

Target: 12

       10
     /    \
    5     15
  /  \   /  \
 2    5 13  22

To get here we have to travel down the binary search tree checking the vlues of the node through navigation the given path. 

1.As long as the current node does not eqaul null we will keep checking for nodes

2. assign the closest value to the target. check each node to see if there is less differnece between target - closest verses target - current value. 


3. depending on if the currentvalue is greater or lesser than the target check the left or right node. 

Time/Space complextity is o(log(n)) best case because each node we check takes half or more values away. O(n) in a worst case if the nodes go all left or all right much like a typical list would.
