Given an array of intergers between 1 and n where n is the length of the array, write a function that returns the first integer that appears more than once (when array is read from left to right).

Out of all the integers that might occur more than once in the input array, your function should return the one whose first duplicate value has the minimum index.

If no interger appears more tha once, your function should return a -1.

note that you're allowed to mutate the input array.

Sample Input #1

array = [2,1,5,2,3,3,4]

output = 2 // 2 is the first interger that appears more than once. 
// 3 also appears more than once, but the second 3 appears after the second 2.
