You're given an array of intergers and an interger. write a function that moves all instances of that interger in the array to the end of the array and returns the array. 

the function shoulf perform this IN PLACE changing the existing array and doesnt need to maintain the order of the other intergers

EXAMPLE:

array = [2,1,2,2,2,3,4,2]
toMove = 2

Sample Output
[1,3,4,2,2,2,2,2] // numbers 1, 3, and 4 could be ordered differently
