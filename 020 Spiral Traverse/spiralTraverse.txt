Write a function that takes in a n*m two dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n==m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all array's elements in spiral order. Starting from top left, goes right, then down, then left, up, and finally repeating these directions if necessary. 

Sample Input:
array = [
 [1,  2,  3,  4],
 [12, 13, 14, 5],
 [11, 16, 15, 6],
 [10,  9,  8, 7],
]

Sample Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]
